# Student-Exam-Portal
The Exam Portal Website is a web application designed to streamline the process of conducting online exams. It allows users to log in, manage their profiles, and create or participate in exams with multiple-choice and written-answer questions, similar to Google Forms.
The platform is built using Node.js and MongoDB for backend functionality and Embedded JavaScript (EJS) for the frontend.
